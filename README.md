Remarks
-------
This repository contains a set of various scripts which try to ease my
daily life. Since the repository contains scripts created by different
people, I've tried to add the respective authors everywhere.

The quality of some scripts are poor (and hopefully improve over time).
In particular, my R and bash scripts are a mess.
