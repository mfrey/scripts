A overview over the scripts in the repository:

	forerunner.sh
	a bash script for exporting data from garmin forerunner watches

	cleanup.sh
	a python script for fixing indentation across multiple python files
	

Remarks
-------
This repository contains a set of various scripts which try to ease my
daily life. Since the repository contains scripts created by different
people, I've tried to add the respective authors everywhere.

The quality of some scripts are poor (and hopefully improve over time).
In particular, my R and bash scripts are a mess.
